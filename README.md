## Problem Statement
**Background:**
Carbon emissions and climate change are pressing global concerns. Reducing carbon emissions at an individual, community, and corporate level is essential. Existing carbon reduction initiatives lack transparency, engagement, and incentives for meaningful participation. There is a need for a platform that can address these shortcomings.

### Carbon Reduction, Net Zero Emissions, and Carbon Trading

The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), in the Earth's atmosphere is contributing to global warming and climate change. Carbon reduction, achieving net-zero emissions, and carbon trading are critical strategies to combat climate change. This document provides an in-depth explanation of these concepts.

### Carbon Reduction

#### Importance of Carbon Reduction

Carbon reduction refers to the process of decreasing the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is essential for several reasons:

- **Mitigating Climate Change:** Reducing carbon emissions is vital to limit global warming and prevent catastrophic climate change impacts.

- **Environmental Preservation:** Lower emissions lead to reduced air pollution, better air quality, and preservation of ecosystems.

- **Economic Benefits:** Transitioning to a low-carbon economy can stimulate innovation and create green jobs.

### Net Zero Emissions

#### Definition

**Net zero emissions** refer to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere and the amount removed from it. Achieving net zero means that any remaining emissions are offset by actions such as reforestation or carbon capture.

#### Importance

- **Climate Stability:** Achieving net zero emissions is crucial for stabilizing global temperatures and preventing severe climate events.

- **Global Commitments:** Many countries and organizations have committed to achieving net zero emissions by mid-century to comply with international climate agreements like the Paris Agreement.

### Carbon Reduction Protocols

Several protocols and agreements outline frameworks for carbon reduction:

1. **Kyoto Protocol:** An international treaty that set binding emission reduction targets for developed countries.

2. **Paris Agreement:** An accord within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

3. **RE100:** A global initiative where companies commit to using 100% renewable energy.

### Carbon Credits

#### Definition

**Carbon credits** are a tradable commodity that represent a reduction or removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from the atmosphere. They are a crucial part of carbon reduction efforts.

### How Carbon Credits Work

- **Emission Reduction Projects:** Projects like renewable energy installations, afforestation, or methane capture generate carbon credits by reducing emissions.

- **Verification:** Independent third-party auditors verify and validate the emission reductions.

- **Issuance:** After verification, carbon credits are issued and registered.

- **Trading:** Credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets.

### Advantages

- **Incentivizing Emission Reduction:** Carbon credits provide a financial incentive for organizations to reduce emissions.

- **Flexibility:** Credits can be used to offset emissions that are challenging to eliminate.

### Carbon Offsetting and Trading

#### Carbon Offsetting

**Carbon offsetting** involves compensating for one's own carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of emissions elsewhere. This can include supporting renewable energy projects, reforestation, or methane capture initiatives.

#### Carbon Trading

**Carbon trading** is a market-based approach where organizations buy and sell carbon credits. It allows for the efficient distribution of emissions reductions.

Carbon reduction, achieving net-zero emissions, and carbon trading are vital strategies in the fight against climate change. By understanding these concepts and participating in carbon reduction efforts, individuals and organizations can contribute to a more sustainable and climate-resilient future.

*Calculating the Carbon Footprint:*

To calculate the individual's carbon footprint based on their responses, you can assign carbon emissions values to each answer option for every question. These values should be in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). For example, "Always" might represent a lower emissions value, while "Rarely" or "Never" might represent a higher emissions value.

For each question, add up the emissions values corresponding to the selected options. Sum these values to calculate the total carbon footprint in units of CO2e. 

Here's a simplified formula:

*Total Carbon Footprint (in kg CO2e) = Emissions from Question 1 + Emissions from Question 2 + ... + Emissions from Question 40*

Example:

Let's say a user provides the following answers:

- Question 1: Heating with natural gas (Emissions = 2.2 kg CO2e)
- Question 2: Air conditioning (Emissions = 3.0 kg CO2e)
- Question 3: Not energy-efficient home (Emissions = 5.0 kg CO2e)
- ... (answers to all 40 questions)

You add up these emissions values for all questions to calculate the user's total carbon footprint.

The result would be the user's estimated carbon footprint in kg CO2e based on their responses.)

3. He can see challenges listed in the website. He can register into one of the challenges.
4. these challenges contain the reward as carbon credits calculated based on the amount of carbon footprint reduction by the individual.
5. these challenges have different time period/deadline (between 3-12 months any) by which the player has to submit the proof of carbon footprint reduction.
6. These challenges have levels and targets (easy (carbon footprint reduction target- 10% to 30% reduction) medium (carbon footprint reduction target- 31% to 60% reduction), hard (carbon footprint reduction target- 61% to 100% reduction))
7. Once the player is done reducing the carbon footprint to target level, he can collect the proofs to prove his reduction and submit it through the form we give. hence he proposes a block into the blockchain.
(Proofs like : Ask users to submit various forms of evidence to support their claims. This can include data, photos, receipts, and other documents. For example:Utility bills showing reduced energy consumption.
Travel records to demonstrate reduced mileage.
Photos of sustainable practices like composting.
Receipts from eco-friendly product purchases.
Records of participation in carbon offset programs.)

8. the proof that is given, that proof is validated by all other players in the blockchain.
9. incase of any discrepancy, or fake proof, the other players can reject that proof, and that block is rejected from adding to the blockchain. 
10. After the block is accepted, the player who submitted the block containing his reduction proof, gets the reward carbon credits (Easy level- 25% carbon credits of the maximum , Medium Level- 50% carbon Credits of maximum, Hard level- 100% Carbon credits of the maximum, maximum=200 carbon credits).
